The BeatApp allows users to create fun beats. The user is able to select three difference beats and change tempo. 
The app was created as a project to practice my javascript and css skills.

Super fun creating this app using simple HTML.  Taking back to basics! :)

*Technologies used: HTML, JavaScript, CSS*
